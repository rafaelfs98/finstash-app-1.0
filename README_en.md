## Backend Structure

Currently, the backend of FINSTASH is built on the [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) framework, a database-as-a-service platform that provides a powerful and user-friendly PostgreSQL API. Supabase simplifies database management and offers a robust API seamlessly integrated with the frontend of this application.

We are planning to establish an official backend using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) in the future to provide even more flexibility and control over business logic. The migration to Spring Boot is on our roadmap to ensure scalability and cater to the specific needs of the project.
